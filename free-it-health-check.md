# Free IT Health Check

The Free IT Health Check is a no-cost, no-obligation review of your current IT and security posture. It’s designed to help organizations understand risks, gaps, and opportunities before problems turn into disruptions.

This service is available to small businesses, churches, private schools, nonprofits, and professional offices throughout the New River Valley.

## What We Review

During the IT Health Check, we take a high-level look at:

- Devices and operating systems  
- Patch and update status  
- Endpoint security coverage  
- Backup and recovery awareness  
- Basic network and Wi-Fi configuration  

The goal is to identify common issues that can impact reliability or security.

## What You Receive

After the review, you receive:

- A plain-English summary of findings  
- Identified risks and areas of concern  
- Practical, prioritized recommendations  

There is no obligation to move forward with services. The intent is to provide clarity and informed next steps.
