# How We Work

NRV Managed IT follows a structured, repeatable process to deliver reliable IT support and cybersecurity.  
Our goal is to provide clarity, consistency, and trust at every stage of the relationship.

Rather than reactive, break-fix support, we focus on proactive management, security, and long-term stability.

---

## 1. Initial Consultation

We begin with a short conversation to understand your organization, current technology, and any concerns or challenges you are facing.

This discussion helps determine:
- Whether managed IT services are a good fit
- What level of support may be appropriate
- Immediate risks or gaps that should be addressed first

There is no obligation — this is about alignment and transparency.

---

## 2. IT Health Check

If we move forward, we perform a baseline review of your technology environment.

This typically includes:
- Devices and endpoints
- Operating system and patch status
- Security posture and antivirus/EDR coverage
- Backup and data protection practices
- User access and basic configuration risks

The goal is not to overwhelm, but to establish a clear starting point.

---

## 3. Findings & Recommendations

After the review, we provide clear, plain-language feedback outlining:
- What is working well
- Where risks or inefficiencies exist
- Practical recommendations to improve stability and security

We focus on **actionable steps**, not unnecessary complexity.

---

## 4. Ongoing Managed IT Support

For organizations that continue with managed services, we provide ongoing monitoring and support focused on prevention and fast response.

This includes:
- Continuous endpoint monitoring
- Automated patching and updates
- Cyber threat detection and response
- Remote support for issues that can be resolved without a site visit
- Clear communication and accountability

Support is predictable, consistent, and aligned with your environment.

## What Clients Can Expect

## Who This Works Best For

This model is especially effective for:
- Small and growing businesses
- Churches and faith-based organizations
- Private schools and educational programs
- Nonprofits and community organizations
- Professional and home offices

Organizations that value trust, consistency, and proactive support benefit most from managed IT.
