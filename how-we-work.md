# How We Work

We use a structured, repeatable process to deliver reliable IT support and security—no guesswork, no surprises.

---

## 1. Initial Consultation
We begin with a short conversation to understand your environment, concerns, and goals.

---

## 2. IT Health Check
A baseline review of your systems to identify risks, gaps, and improvement opportunities.

You receive a plain-English summary of findings.

---

## 3. Recommendations
Clear, prioritized recommendations based on risk and business impact.
No pressure. No jargon.

---

## 4. Onboarding
If you choose to proceed, systems are securely onboarded, documented, and monitored.

---

## 5. Ongoing Support
Proactive monitoring, patching, and security with responsive support when issues arise.

---

## 6. Offboarding
If services end, tools are removed and documentation is provided to ensure a clean transition.

---

Our goal is predictability, security, and trust.
