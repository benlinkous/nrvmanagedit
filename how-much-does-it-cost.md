NRV Managed IT uses a **simple, predictable pricing model** based on the number of devices we manage.

**Cost:**  
➡️ **$35 per endpoint, per month**

There are no long-term contracts required to understand your costs, and pricing scales as your organization grows or changes.

---

## What Is an Endpoint?

An **endpoint** is any device we actively manage, such as:
- Desktop computers
- Laptops or workstations used by staff or volunteers

Each endpoint is priced individually so costs stay transparent and proportional to actual usage.

---

## What the $35 Per Endpoint Includes

Each managed endpoint includes:

### Proactive Monitoring & Maintenance
- Continuous monitoring of system health
- Early detection of issues before they cause disruption

### Patch Management
- Operating system updates
- Security patches
- Approved third-party application updates

### Endpoint Security (EDR / Antivirus)
- Advanced endpoint protection
- Ransomware and malware mitigation
- Monitoring for suspicious or malicious behavior

### Included Remote Support
- **Up to one (1) hour per month, per endpoint**
- Remote troubleshooting and issue resolution
- User assistance and basic system support
- Security-related issues that can be handled remotely

Most routine issues are resolved well within the included support time.

---

## How Support Time Works

- Support time is **allocated per endpoint**
- Time resets monthly
- Remote support is prioritized whenever possible
- Additional needs are discussed in advance

This model helps reduce unexpected costs and encourages proactive system care.

---

## What Is Not Included

The per-endpoint price does not typically include:
- On-site visits
- Hardware purchases or repairs
- Large projects or major migrations
- Issues involving unmanaged or unsupported devices

If work falls outside the standard scope, options are reviewed before any additional effort is performed.

---

## Why This Model Works

This pricing approach:
- Keeps monthly costs predictable
- Scales easily with your organization
- Aligns support effort with device count
- Reduces emergencies through proactive care

It is designed to provide **reliable IT support without surprises**.
